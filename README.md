# Patchwork

> A decentralized messaging and sharing app built on top of Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB).

- Connect with friends without depending on any central servers.
- Don't worry about spam, you only get messages from people you follow.
- Use Patchwork online or offline, the data you need is stored on your device.
- Sync messages with friends when you're on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Keep secrets with private messages, which are *always* end-to-end encrypted.
- Change and improve Patchwork however you'd like, it's free and open source.
