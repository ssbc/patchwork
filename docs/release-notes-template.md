:tada: **Thanks for downloading Patchwork!** :tada:

## Install

Use [your favorite package manager](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork#installation) or install manually.

### Windows

**[`Patchwork-Setup-$$VERSION.exe`][exe]**

### macOS

**[`Patchwork-$$VERSION.dmg`][dmg]**

You must [allow apps from "unidentified" developers](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088).

### Linux

**[`Patchwork-$$VERSION.AppImage`][appimage]**

You may need to [fix the sandbox](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#sandbox).

There are also releases for Debian and Snapcraft:

- **Debian:** [`ssb-patchwork_$$VERSION_amd64.deb`][deb]
- **Snapcraft:** [`ssb-patchwork_$$VERSION_amd64.snap`][snap]
  - You must install with `snap install --dangerous` because it's unsigned.

## Getting started

If this is your first time on Scuttlebutt you may need an invite to get connected. After installing Patchwork and choosing your name you should select the **Join Pub** button. You'll need to [get a pub invite](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-server/wiki/Pub-Servers#public-pubs), paste it into the prompt, and select **Redeem invite**.

You can find more information in the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/getting-started).
